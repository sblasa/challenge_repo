            <p>Sometimes, it's tough to get to your "Happy Place". What's a "Happy Place"?
                Well, it's a euphemism to allow yourself to not worry
                about the things that are mentally bothering you. It can 
                really be anything or even anyone.


                It's a place you mentally go to calm your mind.
