            <p>Sometimes, it's tough to get to your "Happy Place". What's a "Happy Place"?
                Well, it's a euphemism to allow yourself to not worry
                about the things that are mentally bothering you. It can 
                really be anything or even anyone. 
                It's a place you mentally go to calm your mind.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are a few things that get me to my happy place: <br/>
                <li>Hot Fudge Brownie Sundae</li>
                <li>Flowers--yeah, I know. Girly.</li>
                <li>Mochas</li>
                <li>Shoes</li>
                <li>Books</li>
                <li>Spin Class</li>

            </p>
            I wish I could visit these places more often!
